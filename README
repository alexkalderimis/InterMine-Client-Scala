Implementation of A Web-Service Client for the InterMine API
============================================================

This project aims to have a functional API client that can:
  * Create and run queries
  * Create and use templates
  * Read and use lists
  * Request query summaries and counts
  * Lazily iterate over result sets

And all in idiomatic scala.
